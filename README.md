## Future Plans
- [ ] Set up a Python (FastAPI) backend for scraping + ML
- [ ] Create ML model to work on flavor suggestions using synthetic data set. This model will be used concurrently with the AI model for difficult rankings.
- [ ] Switch away from Instagram API to web scraping
- [ ] Remove layering of shading from UI for a cleaner look and add accented borders
- [ ] Add a frequency setting to allow people to set their frequency multiplier (so that people who love ice cream would see more recommendations, even if they don't fit as well)
